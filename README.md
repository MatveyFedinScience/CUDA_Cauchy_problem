# CUDA_Cauchy_promblem
High efficient program for solving Cauchy problem on a circle

Currently, this program has limited functionality, allowing one to track the evolution of a system of non-interacting particles launched at a single speed in one of three directions. In the future, it is planned to allow each particle to be assigned its own speed and direction of motion.
